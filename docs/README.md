# Documentation

Project documentation for Aventuras. Wireframes and design rationale
that drive UI work, schema and architectural decisions that drive
implementation, and the open questions tracked across the project.

## What's here

- **[architecture.md](./architecture.md)** — pipeline, generation
  context, agent orchestration, retrieval, translation. How code is
  organized.
- **[data-model.md](./data-model.md)** — schema, decisions, the
  `entities` / `lore` / `threads` / `happenings` shapes. What's
  stored.
- **[memory.md](./memory.md)** — how prose and structured world state
  stay consistent turn by turn, what gets injected into each
  generation call, how older content ranks against current scene
  context. Cadence, embedding infrastructure, retrieval queries,
  pinning.
- **[calendar-systems/](./calendar-systems/README.md)** — tiered-counter
  primitive for in-world date-time display, classifier vocabulary,
  and (eventually) user-authored fictional calendars. Design spec,
  interactive PoC, and shareable preset JSONs.
- **[tech-stack.md](./tech-stack.md)** — tech choices and rationale.
- **[followups.md](./followups.md)** — active outstanding items the
  current milestone (v1) needs answered or that block v1 work.
- **[parked.md](./parked.md)** — deferred items: post-v1 confirmed
  - parked-until-signal.
- **[ui/](./ui/README.md)** — UI design: principles + per-screen
  wireframes and docs.
- **[explorations/](./explorations/README.md)** — dated session
  records of design discussions. Frozen historical reasoning;
  canonical docs are authoritative once a design lands.
- **[conventions.md](./conventions.md)** — documentation conventions:
  structure rules, naming, cross-references, principles-vs-patterns
  split, README-as-index, followups hygiene, wireframe authoring,
  tooling, common pitfalls.
