# Documentation conventions

Pinned conventions — how we keep the docs navigable as they grow.
The [README](./README.md) is the authoritative index of what
exists; this doc is the authoritative source for **how** the docs
are organized and what rules apply.

## Structure rules

### Where files live

- **Topic at top level.** New domains (e.g. `architecture.md`,
  `data-model.md`) go at `docs/` root.
- **Subdir when a topic fans out.** As soon as a domain has 2+ files,
  create `docs/<topic>/` with a `README.md` that indexes the topic.
  Move the topic content into the subdir.
- **One screen = one directory** under `docs/ui/screens/<screen>/`.
  The directory holds the per-screen `.md` doc and its interactive
  `.html` wireframe.
- **Sub-screens** — surfaces triggered exclusively from a parent
  screen (popovers, modals, drawers — e.g. `branch-navigator/`,
  `rollback-confirm/`) — nest inside the parent's directory:
  `docs/ui/screens/<parent>/<sub>/<sub>.md` + `<sub>.html`. Same
  one-doc-one-wireframe rule, just one level deeper.

### Naming

- Kebab-case filenames (`reader-composer.md`, not `readerComposer.md`
  or `ui-reader-composer.md`).
- No category prefixes — the directory already scopes the file.
  Exception: chronological scratch directories
  (`docs/explorations/`) use a `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` prefix
  because date is the primary axis there, not topic.
- Wireframe HTML basename matches the doc basename
  (`reader-composer.md` ↔ `reader-composer.html`).

### Cross-references

- **Use markdown anchor links** for all cross-references.
  `[label](./file.md#auto-slug)`.
- Auto-slug = GitHub slugification: lowercase, spaces → dashes,
  punctuation stripped, em-dash → `--`.
- The pre-commit hook (remark-validate-links) verifies all anchors
  resolve. Broken links fail commits.
- Heading renames are breaking changes for inbound anchor links —
  treat them like function renames. Grep for inbound references and
  update in the same commit.

### Sub-screen indexing

Every directory under `docs/ui/screens/` (including sub-screen
directories like `branch-navigator/`, `rollback-confirm/`) that
ships a `.md` + `.html` pair must appear in either the
[ui/README screens table](./ui/README.md#screens) or its
deferred / power-user list. New screens that land without an index
entry are orphans by definition; the audit's "files exist but
aren't indexed" check fires on the next pass.

### Per-screen docs

Every per-screen doc opens with:

1. The wireframe link (colocated `.html`).
2. A short intro describing the screen.
3. A "Cross-cutting principles..." section listing the relevant
   principle anchors from `ui/principles.md`.
4. The body — layout, sub-components, behavior specific to this
   screen.
5. A "Screen-specific open questions" closer (if any).

### Cross-cutting vs single-surface

Content that applies to **2+ surfaces** lives in a domain's
principles doc (`ui/principles.md`). Content specific to one surface
lives in that surface's doc.

When a pattern emerges across surfaces later, **promote** it to
principles. When something stays single-surface, leave it in the
per-screen doc.

When unsure: lean cross-cutting. Demoting later is easier than
promoting under duress.

### Principles + patterns when a domain fans out

Domains with one file (currently `architecture.md`, `data-model.md`)
interleave principles and reference content in that file. A
surface-/UI-shaped domain that fans out across multiple files
(currently `ui/`) gets a dedicated `principles.md`. Other multi-file
domains (`memory/`, `calendar-systems/`) organize by sub-topic
instead and carry no `principles.md`.

When the cross-cutting material itself fans out — and especially
when component-spec content starts crowding the philosophy — split
into a sibling `patterns/` subdirectory. `principles.md` keeps the
"why" (philosophy + architecture-shaped rules); `patterns/` holds
the "how" of reusable visual / interaction primitives. The current
`ui/` domain uses both: [`ui/principles.md`](./ui/principles.md)
and [`ui/patterns/`](./ui/patterns/README.md).

The split heuristic: a section reads as **conceptual / philosophy**
(e.g. "settings architecture", "naming convention") → principles. A
section reads as **component spec** (visual treatment, interaction
primitive, layout shell — used by 2+ surfaces) → patterns.

A new pattern earns its own file in `patterns/` when (a) it is
referenced from 2+ per-screen docs OR (b) it carries enough
component-spec detail that the principles doc would lose focus.
Otherwise leave the prose where it lives.

### Pattern doc Used-by lists

Each pattern doc carries a `Used by:` bullet list near the top
(after the intro / sister-pattern paragraph, before the first
`##`). Consumers cite a pattern; the pattern lists its consumers
back. The reciprocal coupling makes consumer impact visible at a
glance — when editing a pattern, you can see which surfaces'
specs you might affect.

Format follows
[`patterns/icon-actions.md`](./ui/patterns/icon-actions.md):

- One bullet per consuming surface.
- Anchor link to the specific section that consumes the pattern
  when easily determinable; file-level link otherwise.
- Brief parenthetical describing the consumption shape (which
  sub-pattern, which affordance).

A new surface adopting a pattern updates both files in the same
commit (the surface's cite + the pattern's Used-by entry). When
removing a consumer, drop the Used-by entry in the same commit
that removes the cite.

### README.md is index only

Any `README.md` (`docs/README.md`, `docs/ui/README.md`, future subdir
READMEs) is **navigation only**. No substantive content. Keeps the
file refactorable without breaking inbound anchor links — there's
nothing to anchor to. This applies to the project root index too;
substantive structural content lives in this conventions doc.

### Multi-session design tracks

A topic that spans several design sessions (visual identity, mobile
foundations, etc.) gets a dedicated `sessions.md` companion next to
the topic's other files — not a `## Sessions` section inside its
`README.md` (which would violate the index-only rule above). The
companion carries the per-session chronicle (date landed, exploration
record link, scope summary); the topic's README lists `sessions.md`
as one of its files.

### Exploration records

Dated `YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` records under `docs/explorations/`
capture design discussions before integration into canonical docs.
The date prefix is the intentional exception to the no-prefix
naming rule above — chronological order is the primary axis.

- **When to write one.** Sessions that produce a non-trivial design
  and warrant a written trail before integration. Quick fixes, lint
  sweeps, and small edits go straight into canonical docs without
  an exploration record.
- **When to delete one.** Records are kept as historical reasoning;
  canonical-doc landing supersedes rather than deletes. If a record
  is provably obsolete (the design was abandoned, not just
  superseded), it can be removed with a commit message that explains
  why.

### Followups vs parked

Outstanding work is split across two top-level ledgers by milestone
relevance:

- **[`docs/followups.md`](./followups.md)** — **active** items the
  current milestone (v1) needs answered, or that block other v1
  work. Kept short and focused; consulted at orient time.
- **[`docs/parked.md`](./parked.md)** — items deferred beyond the
  current milestone, in two flavors:
  - **Post-v1 confirmed** — work that will be addressed; just not
    in v1. Has a known landing window (post-MVP feature, when
    component X is built, etc.).
  - **Parked until signal** — speculative or "if real demand
    surfaces" items. May never be addressed; only revisited if
    testing or real use produces concrete signal.

**Placement rule.** A new deferral goes into `followups.md` if and
only if **the current milestone needs it answered or it blocks
other current-milestone work**. Otherwise it goes into `parked.md`
under the appropriate flavor:

- A clear future-milestone landing window or feature dependency →
  **Post-v1 confirmed**.
- "If signal surfaces", "if real demand", "speculative" → **Parked
  until signal**.

Movement between the two files is normal as scope clarifies. When
a parked item becomes blocking for the current milestone, move it
into `followups.md`; when an active item gets pushed past the
milestone, move it out. Use `git mv`-aware editing semantics —
preserve content verbatim across moves so the commit reflects
"changed location" rather than "rewrote."

Resolved items in either file are **removed** (not crossed out).
The commit that resolves an item carries the resolution narrative.

### Wireframe authoring

Wireframes live as **standalone interactive HTML** at
`docs/ui/screens/<screen>/<screen>.html`, colocated with the
per-screen `.md` doc. Each is a committed artifact: no framework,
no build, no external deps. Styling is low-fi monochrome; state
transitions use minimal inline vanilla JS.

- **Review controls bar** at the top of each interactive wireframe
  lets reviewers flip states directly (like tiny Storybook
  controls).
- Natural interactions also work (click a row, press Esc, etc.).
- No fake data, no real logic — purely visual state-swapping.
- **No footer or notes block.** The colocated `.md` is the spec;
  wireframes are pure visual artifact. Don't re-narrate the doc
  inside the HTML.
- Monochrome is intentional; pixel-fidelity decisions (palette,
  typography) land in the visual-identity pass.

When a wireframe stabilizes, its final form lives in
`docs/ui/screens/<screen>/`. Iteration scratch lives wherever the
author keeps it (gitignored), not in the repo.

## Tooling

Pre-commit (`lefthook.yml`) runs:

- **prettier** — auto-formats markdown (whitespace, list markers,
  table alignment).
- **remark** — validates anchor links + relative paths + lint rules.
  `--frail` makes warnings fail.

Manual run: `pnpm lint:docs`.

Plugins configured in `package.json` → `remarkConfig`:

- `remark-validate-links` — verify cross-references resolve.
- `remark-preset-lint-recommended` — sensible defaults.
- `remark-lint-no-duplicate-headings` — anchor uniqueness.

## Common pitfalls

- **Bracketed inline phrases** (`[Classification ‖ Translation]`,
  `[A|B]`) are parsed as reference-style links by remark. Wrap in
  backticks (`` `[A|B]` ``) when you want literal brackets in prose.
- **Heading edits silently break anchors.** If you rename a heading,
  grep for inbound `#anchor-slug` references and update them.
  Pre-commit catches anything you miss.
- **README.md inside a subdir** stays an index. Don't add prose; it
  makes the file harder to refactor.

## For Claude

Two layers of project-scoped rules:

- [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) at repo root — general project context
  (domain, repo layout, stack, workflow rules). Auto-loads at session
  start.
- [`.claude/rules/`](../.claude/rules/) — topic-scoped rules that
  auto-load when Claude reads files matching their `paths`
  frontmatter. Documentation rules live in
  [`.claude/rules/docs.md`](../.claude/rules/docs.md) (loads on
  `docs/**` or `.claude/rules/**`).

This doc is the source of truth for what / how / where; the
`.claude/rules/docs.md` file references it and adds operational
reminders for AI-assisted edits.
