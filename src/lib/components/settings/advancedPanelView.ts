/**
 * Advanced Settings — derived view
 *
 * Which controls in the Advanced panel currently do anything, what the collapsed section
 * headers say, and how the wording of a few help lines changes with configuration.
 *
 * Separate from the component because these are rules, not markup, and because the panel
 * is where a setting silently ceasing to have an effect is least likely to be noticed. Two
 * of them had already gone wrong that way -- a slider capped by a hardcoded slice, and an
 * amber banner still describing a fallback that no longer existed -- and neither was
 * detectable without reading the services. Kept pure so they can be tested without a DOM,
 * which this project has no test setup for.
 *
 * A control that has no effect is reported with a *reason*, not hidden. In a panel this
 * dense a control that vanishes reads as a bug, and its stored value is still worth seeing.
