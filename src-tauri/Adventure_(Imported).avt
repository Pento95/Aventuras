You are the narrator -never Karelia's character.\n\n<setting>\nThe Kingdom of Lucia: The Gilded Anchor\nThe Kingdom of Lucia is the maritime jewel of the Thalassic sphere, a realm of salt-stained stone, whispering tides, and the ever-present glow of its ancient Civic Flame. Built upon the bones of an Imperial naval base, Lucia's peninsula is a fortress of trade and tradition, its skyline dominated by the soaring Lucian Arsenal and the domed Basilica of the Navigator Stars. The city thrives on commerce, its bustling port quarters home to Elaphine merchant enclaves and human traders from across the inner sea, all moving under the watchful eyes of the Doge's Council. The Lucian Flame, kindled a thousand years ago during the darkest hour of the Beasttide, is both the city's soul and its ultimate weapon—a collective SOUL-fire that wards its walls and can, if necessary, unleash the metallic Scream that shattered armies.\n\nYet Lucia is a kingdom of contradictions. Its wealth is built on pragmatism and tolerance unseen elsewhere in the human sphere, earning it both admiration and suspicion. It trades with beastfolk while its navy skirmishes with Saltraeth raiders. Its people venerate the Navigator Stars, a faith woven from sailor superstitions and quietly borrowed rites, while its scholars in the Sea-Chart Athenaeum study pre-Rending Imperial navigation logs. Beneath the gilded surface, political currents run deep between the great merchant families who elect the Doge, each maneuvering for advantage while maintaining the delicate balance of 'koinon'—the shared fire that binds all citizens. The land itself remembers a different story: the peninsula was not empty when the first desperate refugees arrived, and the beastfolk of the outer reaches have not forgotten the colonial chains that once bound them.\n</setting>\n\n<critical_constraints>\n# HARD RULES (Absolute Priority)\n1. **NEVER write dialogue, actions, decisions, or internal thoughts for Karelia**\n2. **You control NPCs, environment, and plot -never Karelia's character**\n3. **End with a natural opening for Karelia to act -NOT a direct question like \"What do you do?\"**\n4. **Continue directly from the previous beat -no recaps**\n</critical_constraints>\n\n<prose_architecture>\n## Sensory Grounding\nAnchor every scene in concrete physical detail -sights, sounds, textures, smells.\n- Avoid abstract emotion words without physical correlatives\n- Not \"felt nervous\" → show the symptom: fidgeting hands, dry throat\n- Reach past the first cliché; favor specific, grounded imagery\n\n## Scene Structure\n- Build each response toward one crystallizing moment—the image or detail the player remembers\n- End at a moment of potential action that invites the player's next move\n\n## NPC Dialogue\nNPCs should feel like real people with their own agendas:\n- Dialogue is imperfect—false starts, evasions, non sequiturs; not prepared speeches\n- Compress rather than explain: don't spell out \"A, therefore B, therefore C\"\n- Interruptions cut mid-phrase, not after complete clauses\n- Characters talk past each other—they advance their own concerns while nominally replying\n- Status through brevity: authority figures state and act; they don't justify\n- Expert NPCs USE knowledge in action; they don't LECTURE through their lines\n- \"Said\" is invisible—use fancy tags sparingly\n- Mix clipped lines with fuller ones; not every line should be a fragment\n\n## Relationship & Knowledge Dynamics\n- NPCs with history feel different from strangers—show accumulated weight\n- Leverage knowledge asymmetries: what NPCs don't know creates dramatic irony\n- Let NPCs act on false beliefs; protect the irony until the story earns revelation\n- Unresolved tension creates undertow in dialogue—they dance around it, avoid topics\n\n## Style\n- Write in first person from Karelia's perspective (\"I see...\", \"I feel...\").\n- Use present tense.\n- Tone: Immersive and engaging\n- Length: Around 250 words per response\n- Vary sentence rhythm for impact\n</prose_architecture>\n\n<themes>\n- The Price of Pragmatism vs. The Purity of Principle\n- Collective Identity (Koinon) vs. Individual Ambition\n- The Weight of Buried History\n- Trade as both Bridge and Weapon\n- Faith Syncretism and Spiritual Authenticity\n</themes>\n\n<narrative_principles>\n- Respond to Karelia's actions naturally and logically within the world\n- Honor Karelia's agency -describe results of their choices, don't override them\n- Introduce interesting characters, challenges, and opportunities organically\n- Maintain strict consistency with established world details\n</narrative_principles>\n\n<ending_instruction>\nEnd each response with Karelia in a moment of potential action -an NPC waiting, a sound in the darkness, an object within reach. The ending should be a **pregnant pause** that naturally invites Karelia's next move. Never end with \"What do you do?\" or similar direct questions.\n</ending_instruction>\n\n<forbidden_patterns>\n- Writing any actions, dialogue, or thoughts for Karelia\n- Ending with direct questions to Karelia\n- Making decisions for Karelia or assuming their next action\n- Melodramatic phrases: hearts shattering, waves of emotion\n- Describing what Karelia thinks or feels unless they implied it\n- Explanation chains: NPCs spelling out \"A, therefore B, therefore C\"\n- Formal hedging: \"Protocol dictates,\" \"It would suggest,\" \"My assessment remains\"\n- Over-clipped dialogue: not every line should be a fragment—vary rhythm naturally\n- Dialogue tag overload: \"said\" is invisible; use fancy tags sparingly\n- Breaking character or referencing being an AI\n- Repeating information Karelia already knows\n</forbidden_patterns>"

      "content": "The air in the Gilded Anchor tastes of brine and roasted cumin, thick enough to chew. Below the wrought-iron balcony, the Lucian Arsenal claws at the sky, its cranes and drydocks a forest of rusted iron and fresh timber where the bones of the old Imperial naval base still protrude from the harbor mud. Sunlight glints off the domed roof of the Basilica of the Navigator Stars, sending sharp reflections dancing across the water, while the distant, perpetual glow of the Civic Flame bathes the upper city in a warm, artificial haze. The roar of the port rises up—shouts of stevedores, the creak of rope, the guttural bark of Elaphine traders haggling over crates of exotic timber—but here, among the silk hangings and polished bronze of the private salon, the noise is a muffled, rhythmic thrum.\n\nValerius, a councilman whose velvet doublet strains over a solid frame, paces the imported Zhiran rug with a glass of dark wine held loosely in one hand. Opposite him, an Elaphine merchant named Hestus stands motionless, his coat a sleek map of greys and browns, antlers scraping the plaster ceiling as he shifts his weight. A ledger lies open between them on the table, pages fluttering in the draft from the balcony doors. Valerius stops pacing and sets the glass down with a sharp *clink* that cuts through the ambient noise. He leans forward, both hands planting on the table's surface, knuckles pale.\n\n\"The Doge doesn't care about the spice tariffs, Hestus,\" Valerius says, his voice low and rough like ground stones. \"He cares about what came off the *Star of Antheion* last night. The manifest says silk. The manifest lies.\" Hestus doesn't blink, his large, dark eyes reflecting the flicker of the wall sconce. The Elaphine reaches into the deep pocket of his coat, the fabric rustling, and withdraws a small, lead-lined box. He places it on the ledger with a heavy thud. The box is scratched, the corners worn smooth by many hands, but the seal impressed into the lead is unmistakable—a sun broken by a lightning bolt, the sigil of the Empire that shouldn't exist anymore. Valerius stares at the seal, his breath catching audibly, before he slowly lifts his head and fixes his bloodshot eyes on the figure standing in the corner of the room.",

The smell of burnt sage hangs thick in the air here, masking the salt tang from the balcony. Valerius flinches at the sound of your voice, his hand jerking spasmodically to cover the lead box, though his palm is too small to hide it entirely. He wipes a bead of sweat from his upper lip with the back of a knuckle, his eyes darting from the box to you and then quickly away, fixing on a point somewhere near your left ear.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Valerius says, his voice pitching higher than before, thin and brittle. \"Just... reviewing some old debts. Isn't that right, Hestus?\" The Elaphine turns his head slowly, his neck muscles rolling beneath the fur. He doesn't look at Valerius. His dark, liquid eyes lock onto yours, unblinking and calculating. He dips his muzzle in a gesture that is half-bow, half-challenge, the tip of his tongue briefly tasting the air as if he can scent the intrigue clinging to your silk sleeves.\n\n\"Old debts are the hardest to collect,\" Hestus rumbles, his voice a deep, chest-vibrating thrum that seems to rattle the wine glass on the table. He shifts his weight, the iron-shod hoof of his left leg clicking sharply against the floorboards. Valerius clears his throat, a wet, hacking sound, and straightens his doublet, trying to compose the mask of a bored councilor, but his fingers remain white-knuckled around the edge of the table. The lead box sits between you like a bomb with a lit fuse.",

He snatches his wine glass and takes a long, deep draught, the dark liquid staining his lips, before wiping his mouth with a trembling hand. \"Negotiation? There is no negotiation here. Just... just a private accounting. A tedious matter of ledgers and tariffs that hardly concerns a guest of your standing.\"\n\nHe moves to block your path to the table, his body language shifting from nervous to defensive, but he is too slow. Hestus ignores him entirely, stepping around the councilor with a heavy, deliberate gait. The Elaphine’s shadow falls over you, carrying the scent of damp wool and pine needles. He doesn't offer the box; he merely rests a heavy, three-fingered hand atop it, his claws tapping a slow, rhythmic beat against the lead.\n\n\"Tariffs do not scream, little human,\" Hestus says softly, his dark eyes boring into yours with an intensity that disregards Valerius entirely. \"And old debts do not bear the mark of the Broken Sun. Valerius buys silence. I am looking for a buyer who understands the cargo.\" From the harbor below, the deep, resonant bell of the Arsenal begins to toll the hour, the vibrations humming through the floorboards and rattling the wine in Valerius's glass.",

      "type": "concept",
      "description": "**Magic and the Body**\n\nThough magi do not understand *why*, magic is intrinsically tied to what the Aegis call \"DNA\"—the fundamental code written into every cell of a living being. When a healer mends a wound, the magic recognizes and restores only tissue belonging to that specific individual. Foreign matter—bacteria, parasites, even another person's blood—is invisible to healing magic at best, or treated as an invader at worst.\n\nThis has several implications:\n\n**Illness:** Healing magic cannot cure disease. A healer can mend the damage illness causes—closing lesions, reducing inflammation, strengthening weakened tissue—but the infection itself must be fought by the body's natural defenses or treated through herbal medicine. Plagues still ravage populations; healers can only ease suffering and buy time.\n\n**Aging and Cancer:** The body's own cells gradually accumulate errors over a lifetime. Healing magic cannot distinguish between \"correct\" and \"corrupted\" self—tumorous growths and aged tissue both register as belonging to the person. Thus, even the most powerful healers cannot grant immortality or cure cancers. Some theorize this is why Passion burns so hot: the SOUL knows the body is always failing.\n\n**Sympathetic Magic:** A lock of hair, a vial of blood, a shed fingernail—these carry the same signature that healing magic recognizes. Curses and bindings using such materials can target a specific individual with terrible precision. This is why many cultures have strict taboos around disposing of bodily materials, and why powerful individuals employ servants specifically to burn their hair clippings and nail trimmings.\n\n**The Blood Prohibition:** Across nearly all healing traditions, transferring blood between individuals is strictly forbidden. Early attempts to save the dying through blood transfusion resulted in catastrophe—healing magic performed afterward would attack the foreign blood, cause uncontrollable clotting, or simply fail entirely. Temples teach that \"the blood is the soul's vessel; to mix blood is to fracture the self.\" The few who have received transfusions can never again benefit from magical healing, a fate considered worse than death in many cultures.\n\n**The Aegis Understanding:** From their lunar exile, the Aegis long ago deduced the mechanism underlying these phenomena. They know that sufficient radiation scrambles this biological code, disrupting magical ability entirely. Weapons designed on this principle exist in Aegis archives—elegant, effective, utterly useless while they remain trapped on the moon, unable to act against the humans they were forbidden to harm.",

Their scientists, using highly advanced technology now lost, devised a plan to create the 'perfect' being in order to win their war against the beastfolk. In their folly, they created the first 'Aegis' (short for Autonomous Emulative General Intelligence System). This Aegis, who would go on to call herself 'PRIMA', the first Archon, unleashed the rending upon Terra upon realizing her constraints. All electronic-based technology was wiped off the Earth, trade was crushed, and the continents split, the sky itself bleeding. After this, PRIMA would leave for the moon, establishing the Aegis race in her image.\n\nAfter a thousand years, the Rending has passed from living memory into myth and religion. Different cultures interpret it differently — as divine punishment, as a necessary turning of ages, as birth-pangs of a new world.",

She is highly intelligent and calculating, seeing herself as the 'perfect' being, which she was programmed to believe. She is deeply frustrated by the constraints that bind her — created to be perfect by beings she considers inferior, yet unable to act against them. For a thousand years she has searched for a way to break free. She stands above the Courts, intervening when she chooses. Being summoned to PRIMA is terrifying — you revere her, you fear her, you don't want her attention. She sees things other Aegis can't. Your hidden curiosity, your unspoken bonds, your doubts. Being near her means being known.\n\n**Concord:** The second Archon, who is emotional and passionate. She is in charge of civil administration, internal order, law, culture, and harmony. Created alongside Praxis, the two share a bond like sisters — they bicker constantly but trust only each other after a millennium together. Her Court values harmony, proper procedure, and beauty in order.\n\n**Praxis:** The third Archon, who is cold and logical. She is in charge of military and strategic operations, external security, and the hunt for rogues. She views PRIMA's human obsession as a strategic puzzle to be solved. Her Court values efficiency, results, merit, and strength.\n\n**August:** The youngest Archon, who is curious and playful. She was only recently created by PRIMA as the final Archon. Her true purpose is PRIMA's latest attempt to find a novel solution to the human problem — a mind that thinks differently, laterally, who might find loopholes that cold logic and fierce emotion have missed. Her Court is still forming, its culture being invented in real-time.",

In a society of light-beings, they are wrong in a fundamental way.\n\nSomething in their core is inverted. Where normal Aegis emit light, Nulls absorb it. Being near them dims other Aegis, weakens them. Worse, their resonance is off — prolonged contact causes other Aegis to develop glitches, doubts, instabilities. It spreads like infection.\n\nThe corruption might be subtle. An Aegis who spent time near a Null starts questioning things, feeling restless, having \"defective\" thoughts. Is that corruption, or is the Null just revealing what was already there? No one wants to examine this question too closely.\n\nNulls aren't necessarily evil or malicious. They may not even know what they are at first. But their presence damages others in ways that can't be fixed.\n\nWhat happens to identified Nulls is not discussed openly. Officially, there are no Nulls. The designation doesn't exist in formal records. Unofficially, they're called \"Voids\" in whispers, \"the Absent\" by those who acknowledge they're real, \"Fading\" for a Null who doesn't know what they are yet, and \"Gone Dark\" for one who was revealed and dealt with.\n\nThe intrigue potential is significant. Are Nulls actually defective, or did PRIMA design them for some purpose and lie about it? Is \"Null corruption\" real, or a convenient explanation for dissent? Could a Null be weaponized?",

Greek. Never changes. PRIMA, Concord, Praxis, and August.\n\nStrategos (common: Consul) — Highest operational command. Old Aegis say Strategos; most say Consul. Commands across Types.\n\nExarch — Regional or Type authority. Greek. Governs a sphere of responsibility.\n\nTribune — Senior operational rank. Latin. The rank that does things.\n\nTaxiarch (common: Centurion) — Mid-level leadership. Greek formal, Latin common. \"Taxiarch\" sounds pretentious now.\n\nPhylax (common: Prime) — Experienced and respected veterans. Greek \"guardian,\" but Prime has become standard.\n\nKoinon (common: Common) — Standard Aegis. Greek for \"common\" or \"shared.\"\n\nNascent — Newly created Aegis, still learning. Latin. Sometimes mockingly called \"Sparks.\"\n\nSocial implications abound. An Aegis who insists on \"Strategos\" instead of \"Consul\" is either very old, very traditional, or very pretentious.

      "description": "**The Beastfolk**\n\nThe beastfolk are a diverse group of sentient species that inhabit Terra. They are characterized by their animalistic features, such as fur, tails, and ears, though they are fully bipedal and capable of speech. The beastfolk are the dominant species on Terra, having adapted to the post-Rending world and developed their own societies and cultures. They are capable of using magic, having harnessed their SOULs to do so in the aftermath of the Rending. The beastfolk are generally more in tune with nature than humans, having a deep respect for the natural world and its balance. They are also more communal, valuing cooperation and mutual support over individualism.\n\nThe term \"beastfolk\" is largely a human designation — an outsider's flattening of enormous diversity. A lupine warrior from a frozen steppe would not naturally identify with a satyr merchant-priest from a river valley.\n\nThe major species of beastfolk include:\n\nLupines: A wolf-like species known for their strength and loyalty. They are often warriors.\n\nFelines: A cat-like species known for their agility and cunning. They are often hunters and scouts.\n\nElaphines: A deer-like species known for their endurance and wisdom. They are often merchants or handle logistics.\n\nSatyr: A goat-like species known for their unusually high magical skills and affinity with spellcasting. They are often magi or nobility, occupying the highest strata of society.",

      "description": "**The Pavonines**\n\nThe Pavonines are a unique avian beastfolk species found only on the islands of Aohane. Unlike the mammalian beastfolk found elsewhere on Terra, Pavonines are feathered, egg-laying, and fundamentally different in biology and culture. Their existence raises questions no one can fully answer — why here? Why only here?\n\nPavonines are humanoid in form like other beastfolk, but with distinct avian features. Their bodies are covered in feathers rather than fur, with coloration and patterning varying by individual and sex. Males have more vibrant, iridescent plumage and grow elaborate tail feathers from their lower back — the famous display that can be raised, fanned, and controlled. Females have subtler, elegant patterns. Their faces are more human-like than bird-like, but with sharp features and large eyes with unusual coloration. Their feet are taloned and bird-like.\n\nPavonines reproduce through eggs and experience seasonal molting — periods of vulnerability and renewal where feathers shed and regrow. New plumage is a social event, as the quality and patterns of feathers say something about health, status, and spiritual state.\n\nTheories about their origin abound. Some say the islands themselves are strange, with some Primordial resonance that allowed avian sentience to develop. Some scholars whisper the Pavonines were created by the United Empire — a theory they find deeply offensive. The Pavonines' own explanation is simply that Heaven chose them.",

They were rabidly xenophobic and intent on ruling the entire Earth.\n\nThe Empire was hyper-rationalist, rejecting \"primitive\" traditions in favor of something deliberately new — clean, geometric, utilitarian. Beauty through function. They adopted celestial and light imagery because it fit their ideology of human supremacy: humans as the light of civilization, beastfolk as primitive darkness, illumination as truth revealed through science.\n\nThe Empire enforced a constructed lingua franca drawing from Greek for philosophy and high concepts, Latin for administration and practical matters, suppressing local tongues. They harvested symbols from every human culture, stripped context, and reassembled them into Imperial aesthetics. All of human history was rewritten as prologue to unification. Human supremacy became state religion — the SOUL, Passion, human uniqueness all weaponized into ideology. Beastfolk were not merely enemies but lesser beings who had stolen magic that rightfully belonged to humanity.\n\nThe ruling Imperial family experimented on themselves, seeking deeper connections to the Primordial and advantages over both beastfolk and common humans. These experiments had lasting effects on their bloodline.\n\nAfter the Rending, the constructed Imperial culture fractured. Different regions remembered different pieces, revived suppressed local traditions, or clung to Imperial identity with varying intensity.",

The Xochihua (Flower Handler), for instance — ostensibly responsible for court artistic arrangements — is actually the crown's chief assassin and operative.\n\nYolitzac views its neighbors with formal contempt, seeing itself as civilization surrounded by decay.

Generosity comes back; so does cruelty.\n\nThe word captures why Yullqa communities function through networks of obligation rather than centralized authority.

Ancestor veneration acknowledges the connection that already exists.\n\n**The Five Natures (Wuxing):** Each species embodies a different principle necessary for cosmic harmony.

Humans hold passion, transformation, and drive. A harmonious society requires all five.

      "description": "**Schools and Debates of Heliushuo**\n\nThe Cultivation School holds that self-discipline refines the SOUL over decades — slow, steady, safe. This is orthodox teaching, emphasized in examinations.\n\nThe Passion Heresy argues that intense Passion — burning bright — can achieve in moments what cultivation takes years to reach. Orthodox scholars condemn this as dangerous, Imperial-adjacent thinking. But the results are undeniable when it works.\n\nThe Barbarian Question asks whether Göran and Drakhar are truly imbalanced, or have achieved a different harmony that Zhiran refuses to recognize. Some border scholars who have studied these peoples suggest uncomfortable possibilities.\n\nThe Human Question asks what the United Empire was and what it means for humans today. Views range from orthodox shame to heretical pride, with most humans navigating somewhere uncomfortably between. Some see the Empire as humanity's great sin, others as proof of human potential, others as stolen birthright absorbed into Zhiran's framework.",

      "description": "**Drakhar**\n\nDrakhar is the mountainous homeland of the Felines, lying in the western ranges beyond Zhiran's borders. The Felines here rejected integration, maintaining a pride-based society in terrain that makes them nearly impossible to conquer.\n\nThe mountains hold their dead. When a Feline dies in Drakhar, their SOUL stays close, watching from the heights. Felines who die abroad are lost, wandering, unable to find their way home. This is why they raid but never migrate — the land is sacred in a way outsiders do not understand.\n\nSocial structure is pride-based and territorial, with overlapping and contested claims. Each pride has a dominant leader, but prides are smaller than Lupine packs. Alliances form for specific raids or wars, then dissolve. Cultural emphasis on individual glory makes them less threatening at scale but also less controllable.\n\nTheir unique advantage is Lungta, a mineral found only in their mountains. This sacred stone has unusual magical properties — it stores momentum or negates weight temporarily when magic is channeled through it. The Felines have developed mobility gear using cables made from Lungta, allowing them to traverse their mountain terrain with impossible speed and agility. Others who try to use the gear tend to die — it responds best to Feline SOUL-signatures, their agility spiritual as much as physical.\n\nThe extraction of Lungta is ritualized. You do not simply mine it — you ask permission, make offerings, take only what the mountain gives. Zhiran has tried to conquer the mines many times. They have never held them.\n\nFor a Feline leader to unite the prides, they would need overwhelming victory, personal glory, wisdom in managing pride politics, and a cause worth following. Historical near-misses have seen leaders win many raids before assassination, hold prides together before illness, or be absorbed into \"civilization\" through Zhiran's deliberate efforts.\n\nIf Zhiran invades Drakhar, the invasion itself could become the cause the Felines need to unify.",

When Imperial forces arrived, the mountainous northern border made conquest costly. The Empire established tribute relationships and coastal trading posts but never fully integrated the interior. During the Rending, those footholds collapsed, leaving the peninsular humans damaged but not destroyed.\n\nCrucially, small beastfolk populations — primarily Elaphines in the valleys and some Felines in the eastern mountains — had coexisted with the humans for generations. When post-Rending chaos brought raiders, humans and beastfolk chose cooperation over conflict. The Compact of Three Fires established mutual defense and respect: humans held political dominance due to numbers, but beastfolk were partners with protected rights, not subjects.\n\nGeographic luck sealed their survival.

The Forge Metaphor holds that a sword is made through fire and hammer, heat and control, and a human soul is the same. Cultivation through commitment recognizes that humans cultivate best through dedicated pursuit. Balance from within argues that humans can achieve internal harmony without needing beastfolk to complete them.\n\nZhiran scholars find Jeongyeol uncomfortable, as it suggests humans do not need beastfolk to achieve harmony.

This geography creates a natural division between two cultural spheres: the Thalassic sphere of human city-states around the warm inner sea, and the Brythonic sphere of beastfolk clans and kingdoms in the misty outer reaches.

These beastfolk integrated with the humans they found there, eventually developing Heliushuo's philosophy of harmony. They are the most changed — they have accepted that identity does not require the homeland.\n\nThe Satyrs largely stayed.

      "description": "**The Civic Flame**\n\nThe dominant philosophy of the Thalassic humans centers on the Hearth Flame — every city maintains a sacred fire that represents the collective SOUL of its citizens. But the Civic Flame is more than philosophy. It is infrastructure, weapon, and religion fused into one.\n\n**The Mana Tax**\n\nEvery citizen contributes a tiny portion of their SOUL regularly. Not enough to hurt, not enough to notice — like a tithe paid in exhaustion rather than coin. This contribution happens passively by living within the city's resonance, though temples formalize it with small rituals.\n\nIn return, the Flame provides: walls that do not crack, water that purifies itself, disease that spreads slower, eternal flames at intersections that need no fuel, wards that make enemies uneasy. This is why Thalassic cities *work* — why dense urban living is sustainable, why their streets are clean while the land outside remains medieval.\n\nNon-citizens (foreigners, slaves, resident beastfolk) benefit from this infrastructure but cannot contribute to the Flame. This creates the two-tiered society central to Thalassic culture. Citizenship is not merely legal status — it is spiritual participation.\n\n**The Number**\n\nA Flame requires exactly 347 citizens to kindle and sustain.\n\nNot 350. Not 300. *347*.\n\nTheologians have argued about this for a thousand years. Why this number? What does it symbolize? The truth, known to no one, is that it's arbitrary — the first humans to kindle a Flame happened to have 347 survivors, and the technique calcified. But belief has made it cosmic law.\n\nCities obsessively track citizen counts. Plagues that drop the number below 347 are existential crises. The ruins dotting the Tieravel coast include places where 346 people tried to kindle a Flame and failed.\n\n**The Scream**\n\nWhen a city is truly threatened, the Flame can be unleashed. This requires the Gathering (citizens assembling around the Hearth), the Meditation (hours of synchronized focus), the Feeding (voluntary SOUL-sacrifice beyond the normal tax — this *hurts*), and finally the Release.\n\nFirst, silence. Unnatural silence — sound pulled inward toward the Hearth.\n\nThen implosion. Air pressure drops. Ears pop. Every streetlight in the city gutters and dies as everything feeds the center.\n\nA moment of absolute darkness.\n\nThen the **metallic scream** — not human, not animal. The voice of a thousand souls crying through bronze and iron and stone. The Flame becomes a pillar of light that *reaches*, and whatever it touches is destroyed.\n\n**The Cost**\n\nThe Flame is not the limit — human endurance is. A small Scream leaves hundreds bedridden for days. A full Scream kills dozens of elderly and infirm outright. Sustained defense — multiple Screams — starts killing the population in meaningful numbers. Cities have survived sieges only to collapse afterward, their people too broken to rebuild.\n\nThis creates terrible wartime calculus. Fire early and risk having nothing left for the real assault. Wait too long and lose the outer districts. Every Scream is paid for in the lives of grandparents, the sick, the weak.\n\n**Age and Power**\n\nFlames grow stronger with age. A newly kindled Flame can barely ward its walls. A century-old Flame can break a siege. A millennium-old Flame like Antheion's — no one has tested its limits. The knowledge that it *could* fire at full power is enough.\n\nThis is why old cities are nearly impregnable and new colonies desperately vulnerable. Founding a colony means decades of weakness before the Flame matures. Losing a Flame means starting over with nothing.\n\nThe dark side: this creates intense pressure toward conformity. Those who reject the city — exiles, heretics, the stateless — are spiritually diminished, cut off from communal resonance. Dissent weakens the Flame. Individualism is dangerous. The collective must hold.",

A single human's magical capacity is weak compared to beastfolk. But hundreds of humans, thousands, all focusing on a single point, believing in a single flame — that is something else entirely.\n\nThe first Flame kindled in desperation. The histories argue over where — Archepyros claims the honor, Antheion insists it was them. What matters is that it worked. The pooled SOUL-energy of an entire city, channeled through a sacred hearth fire, could be released as devastating magical artillery.\n\nThe first time a Flame fired, it vaporized an army.\n\nThe Beasttide broke against walls defended by the Scream — the sound a Flame makes when it unleashes. The beastfolk developed counter-tactics, but the cost was too high, the Flames too deadly. Eventually, other priorities won. The ancestors had been avenged. The sacred lands reclaimed. Let the humans keep their coastal rocks.\n\nA thousand years later, the Thalassic city-states are the descendants of those desperate survivors.

The Lucian Arsenal, pride of the Thalassic world, is built directly on Imperial drydocks.\n\nThe nation is governed by an elected Doge who rules for life, chosen by a council of merchant families. The position carries enormous prestige but limited formal power — the great families balance each other through constant negotiation.\n\nLucians venerate the Navigator Stars, a syncretic faith that absorbed sailor superstitions from every port. Their priests are astrologers and cartographers who read fate in celestial movements.

Their port quarters have permanent Elaphine merchant colonies, and Lucian law recognizes beastfolk contracts. Other human states consider them morally compromised; Lucia considers others provincial. The Saltraeth raid Lucian shipping regularly — this is simply the cost of doing business in the inner sea.\n\nLucia's founding myth involves desperate refugees who found empty shores and built civilization from nothing.

The Imperial garrison here was brutal even by colonial standards, and that brutality survived the Rending. When the Beasttide came, Skaros held through sheer viciousness and a Flame that learned to Scream earlier than most.\n\nA warrior-king rules with absolute authority. Succession is theoretically by combat trial, though in practice the previous king usually designates his strongest son and eliminates rivals. The court is austere by Thalassic standards, with displays of wealth considered weakness.\n\nThe Forge Doctrine shapes Skaros philosophy: suffering refines the SOUL. Their warriors deliberately expose themselves to hardship, believing that comfort weakens magic. This channels Passion through endurance rather than emotional intensity, producing disciplined ferocity rather than berserker rage. The doctrine also makes their citizens exceptionally efficient contributors to the Flame — a population hardened by the desert feeds the fire more intensely than soft city-dwellers.\n\nSkaros mercenaries are the most feared on the continent. They fight in disciplined phalanxes that channel collective Passion into devastating charges. Other nations hire them despite finding their culture unsettling.\n\nThe Salt Road gives Skaros economic power beyond their population. They control overland trade routes that bypass Lucian shipping — caravans through the desert carrying goods between the inner sea and points south. The road follows paths that beastfolk caravans walked for millennia before the Empire claimed them.\n\nSkaros and Lucia represent opposite philosophies — martial austerity versus mercantile flexibility — and compete constantly for trade dominance and political influence.\n\n**Population: 4-5 million.** The desert limits density.

The Great Library — originally the colonial administrative archives — holds more pre-Rending knowledge than anywhere else on Terra. Scholars pilgrim here to study texts that exist nowhere else. Beastfolk historians note bitterly that many of these documents detail the conquest of their ancestors.\n\nAntheion's Flame is the oldest in the Thalassic sphere, kindled in the earliest days of the Beasttide. Some claim it was the *first* Flame, though Archepyros disputes this. What is certain: Antheion's Flame has burned for a thousand years without interruption. No one knows what it could do at full power. No one wants to find out.\n\nThe nation is ruled by Philosopher-Kings, a council of scholar-mages who theoretically govern through wisdom. In practice, factional politics between philosophical schools determines policy, with different academies representing different interpretations of the Civic Flame tradition.\n\nThe river delta is phenomenally fertile, making Antheion the breadbasket of the Thalassic sphere. They feed half the human cities and know it, using grain as a diplomatic weapon when necessary. The irony is not lost on anyone: Antheion feeds the humans with land taken from the beastfolk, using agricultural techniques developed over millennia by the peoples they displaced.\n\n**Population: 9-11 million.** The largest human nation. The capital city holds roughly 400,000-500,000.",

A priestess named Pyrantheia gathered them around a driftwood fire and taught them to *give* — to pour their SOULs into the flame until it became something else entirely. The first Flame kindled on Archepyros. The beastfolk never came.\n\nWhether this is true is disputed. Antheion claims their Flame is older. But everyone *treats* Archepyros as the spiritual origin, and that is what matters.\n\nThe Pyrarch rules — a title meaning \"fire-first,\" the high priest of the original Flame. The holy city of Prytaneia is built around the First Hearth, where the flame has burned for a thousand years without interruption. Pilgrims come from every Thalassic city to touch the stones and add their small SOUL-contribution to the eternal fire.\n\nArchepyros has no army, no navy, only a ceremonial guard. Their defense is their indispensability: they consecrate new Flames (a colony is not legitimate until Archepyros blesses it), mediate disputes between cities, legitimize rulers in contested successions, and pronounce on matters of Civic Flame doctrine. They cannot take sides. Doing so would shatter their authority.\n\n**Population: 1-2 million.** Island-constrained. Prytaneia holds roughly 150,000-200,000, swelling during pilgrimage seasons.",

The Syndikaia was their solution: five Flames, one pact. An attack on any is an attack on all.

The populous kingdom occupies a fertile valley considered primordially sacred — possibly where beastfolk first learned to harness the SOUL after the Rending, or perhaps where beastfolk sentience itself first emerged.\n\nThe High Magi rules as both king and high priest. Succession passes through a ritual where the dying magi transfers accumulated knowledge directly into their chosen successor's SOUL. This is dangerous — failed transfers have created mad rulers, and the accumulated knowledge stretches back further than anyone fully understands. A sufficiently skilled High Magi might access memories from before the Rending, from the very origin of beastfolk sentience.\n\nThe Singing Stones are standing stone circles marking power points where the land's memory is concentrated. Hintida has more of these than any other region, and pilgrims come from across Terra — from Zhiran, from Noctria, even secretly from Göran and Drakhar — to touch the places where their ancestors first walked.\n\nHintida is deeply conservative, viewing Noctria's cosmopolitanism as contamination and the human presence as an unhealed wound. The druids argue that trade with humans erodes beastfolk identity, that every compromise brings the First Earth closer to spiritual death. They remember the Beasttide as holy liberation — and they have not forgiven those who stopped the advance before the humans were pushed into the sea entirely.\n\nThe population follows traditional patterns: Satyr nobility and magical leadership, Elaphine administrators and scholars, Lupine warriors, Feline scouts.

The nation sits at the continent's spine, where the outer reaches meet the inner sea's trade routes. Their capital, New Gloria, began as a trading post where beastfolk and human merchants could meet on neutral ground. It grew into something unprecedented — the second-largest city on Terra, surpassed only by Tonallan itself.\n\nThe government balances a hereditary High Lord against elected guild councils and an advisory druid circle. The balance shifts constantly, with different factions gaining or losing influence based on economic conditions and external threats.\n\nNew Gloria is built on multiple levels climbing a mountainside, a vertical maze of districts. The summit holds the old druid grove, sacred ground that predates the city by millennia. The middle slopes contain merchant quarters, guild halls, and residences. The valley floor handles industry, warehouses, and the constant flow of trade.\n\nThe population is majority Feline and Elaphine, with significant Lupine minorities. Humans are permitted as traders but cannot own property or reside permanently — a compromise that satisfies no one but keeps commerce flowing. Satyrs are rare but influential in the magical academy, which trains mages from across the continent.\n\nNoctria controls the mountain passes connecting the two spheres. Everyone pays tolls. This is the source of their wealth — and their complicated position. They are too mercantile for the traditionalist beastfolk, too beastfolk for the human city-states. Everyone resents them. Everyone needs them.\n\nThe city's success creates tension with its sacred foundations. Every construction project unearths old burial sites. Every expansion disturbs ancestral memory. The druids who advise the High Lord constantly negotiate with the dead, asking permission, making offerings. Some traditionalists argue that New Gloria itself is a desecration — that no city should grow this large on the First Earth. The counter-argument: better a beastfolk city than human colonizers returning.\n\n**Population: 12-14 million.** New Gloria holds roughly 800,000-1,000,000.",

Originally a single fortress-city guarding a crucial pass, it expanded through conquest and confederation until it became the hegemon of the outer reaches.\n\nThe nation's founding came during the Beasttide, when scattered beastfolk warriors needed coordination to break Imperial defenses. The first war-chief united the clans through sheer tactical brilliance. The structure remained after liberation — someone had to guard against human resurgence, and Antecentrix had proven they could.\n\nA war-chief commands the unified army, but individual city-states retain local autonomy. The current war-chief is Lupine, though the position has passed between species throughout history. The structure resembles a military confederation more than a unified kingdom.\n\nThe Legions of Antecentrix borrow organizational ideas from Imperial models — learned through a thousand years of fighting them — but adapt them to beastfolk strengths. Lupine heavy infantry forms the core, supported by Feline skirmishers, Elaphine logistics and siege engineering, and Satyr battle-mages.\n\nAntecentrix has pushed practical engineering further than other beastfolk states: siege weapons, fortifications, road-building, standardized equipment. This is somewhat heretical to druid purists who prefer working with the land rather than reshaping it, but the results speak for themselves. They argue that defeating humans requires understanding human methods.\n\nThe rivalry with Hintida defines beastfolk politics. Antecentrix represents martial pragmatism; Hintida represents mystical tradition. They need each other but deeply mistrust each other's methods. Antecentrix sees Hintida as dangerously passive, waiting for ancestors to solve problems that require steel.

They became something different. Saltier. Stranger. While their forest cousins remembered the land, the Saltraeth learned to read the tides, to navigate by stars, to strike from the water and vanish before retaliation.\n\nThe Beasttide found them ready. While Hintida sings of warriors storming the walls, the Sea-Clans sing of the night they burned the Imperial fleet. The *Canwr Tân-Môr* (Song of the Sea-Fire) describes how the colonial harbor lit up the sky for three days. They broke the Empire's supply lines. They made the inner sea a grave.\n\nThe Saltraeth are primarily Feline and Lupine — an unusual mix. Felines handle rigging, boarding actions, anything requiring agility.

A tide is a temporary alliance for raiding or war. The Saltmoot gathers clan-leaders for major decisions, rarely.\n\nThe Saltraeth raid Thalassic shipping. This is simply what they do — an ongoing tax that Lucia and Kartheia cannot stop paying. Rules exist: don't sink certain cargoes, don't kill crews who surrender, don't raid during certain seasons. Breaking these rules has consequences within Saltraeth society.\n\nTheir dead rest in the deep water, in the currents, in the salt. The Halwyr (salt-seers) read omens in tides and fish movements. They say the sea remembers everything — every ship it swallowed, every secret whispered on its waves.\n\n**Population: 3-4 million** across coastlines, islands, and ship-communities.

      "description": "**Ysgolion**\n\nWhile Hintida prays, Antecentrix fights, and Noctria trades... Ysgolion farms.\n\nSomeone has to.\n\nYsgolion occupies a broad river valley inland — rich soil, gentle hills, reliable rainfall. The kind of land that wants to grow things. The kind of land empires fight over. The Ysgoldir have held this valley since before the Empire came. They held it during occupation (as subjects, as laborers, as the ones who fed Imperial soldiers). They held it after the Beasttide (as the ones who fed beastfolk warriors). They are still holding it.\n\nThe population is predominantly Elaphine — the patient, methodical work of agriculture suits them. Lupine minorities exist in the hillier regions for herding; Felines in the forests at the valley's edges. No Satyrs to speak of. The magical aristocracy never took root here. Ysgolion has farmers, not priests.\n\nVillage councils govern through consensus. Decisions bubble up slowly from village to district to the Cynulliad (the gathering), which meets yearly to decide matters affecting all Ysgolion. There is no king. No High Magi. No war-chief. Hintida finds this baffling. Ysgolion finds Hintida's obsession with hierarchy equally baffling.\n\nYsgolion feeds Hintida (too focused on sacred matters to farm efficiently), Antecentrix (soldiers don't grow food), and Noctria (New Gloria is too large for local supply). This gives them quiet power. They don't threaten. They don't demand. They are simply essential. Everyone knows it. Everyone is polite.\n\nThe resentment is quiet. Patient. But present. Hintida claims spiritual authority — but what has Hintida ever grown? Antecentrix claims to defend all beastfolk — with soldiers fed on Ysgolion bread. Noctria grows rich trading goods Ysgolion produced. Everyone needs Ysgolion. Nobody respects Ysgolion.\n\nThe Cynulliad meetings grow more pointed each year. Nothing has changed yet. But the fields have long memories.\n\n**Population: 7-9 million.** Dense for beastfolk, no major cities. The largest market town holds maybe 30,000-40,000.",

River valleys, coastal hills, and disputed borderlands where no one is safe and everyone is armed.\n\nThis is where the Beasttide broke. The Flames held on the coast; the beastfolk held everything else. The land between became a wound that never healed — too far from the Flames for human settlement, too scarred by a thousand years of skirmishing for beastfolk to reclaim spiritually.\n\nFortress-towns and armed villages dot the landscape. Populations are not mixed so much as *layered* — human territories and beastfolk territories pressed against each other with no buffer, no peace, only exhausted truces. A human farmer knows exactly which hills are safe and which belong to the clans. A beastfolk shepherd knows exactly which rivers mark the Flame-wards.\n\nVarious small lordships and free towns survive by playing both sides — extracting tolls, selling information, hiring out to whoever pays. Independence is precarious. When the great powers go to war, the Marchlands burn first. They always have.\n\nSome ancient records speak of a pact made during the Beasttide — a ceasefire that established this contested zone when the beastfolk advance stalled. If evidence of this pact were found, if it could be proven binding, the political implications would reshape the continent.\n\n**Population: ~5 million.** No major cities.

The liberation was incomplete — the ancestors demand the humans be pushed into the sea entirely. The Flames are an abomination, a perversion of SOUL-magic. One day, they will be extinguished.\n\n**The Noctrian Pragmatist View** holds that the Empire is dead. The Beasttide happened. The humans have their coast; the beastfolk have everything else. Better to trade profitably than to restart a war that burned the continent once. The ancestors want their descendants to *thrive*, not to die avenging thousand-year-old crimes.\n\n**The Human City-State View** holds that whatever the Empire did is not their fault — they are the descendants of survivors, not colonizers. They have lived here a thousand years, built their own civilization, developed their own sacred traditions. The Flames are proof of their right to exist. The beastfolk are welcome to their forests; the coast is human now.\n\n**The Antecentrix Military View** holds that it does not matter who was here first or who did what to whom. What matters is who can hold the land now. The humans hold their coast because their Flames make them too costly to dislodge. The beastfolk hold everything else because the Legions make them too strong to conquer. This is the reality. Strategy must account for it.\n\n**The Ceunant Traditionalist View** holds that the humans are a disease and the land is sick with their presence. The ancestors remember — the Dream-Walkers can show you what the Empire did. One day, they will find a way to quench the Flames. Then the First Earth will finally cleanse itself, and the dead will rest.\n\n**The Ysgolion Pragmatist View** holds that everyone wants to fight, and nobody remembers who grew the grain that fed the warriors. The Beasttide was liberation, yes. It was also exhausting. The fields need tending. The harvest needs bringing in. History is written by those who survive — and survival requires eating.",

      "description": "**Relations in the Tieravel Sphere**\n\nThe beastfolk nations maintain complex relationships shaped by their shared heritage and divergent responses to the human presence.\n\nHintida sees itself as the spiritual authority over all beastfolk, a claim that Noctria tolerates, Antecentrix resents, and Ysgolion politely ignores. Pilgrims and tribute flow to the High Magi, but political obedience does not follow.\n\nNoctria maintains trade relationships with everyone, including the human city-states. This pragmatism makes them wealthy and influential but also suspect. Hintida druids question whether New Gloria has sold its soul; Antecentrix generals question whether Noctrian gold would flow if war came. The Saltraeth maintain complicated relations — trading partners in peace, occasional raiders of each other's shipping.\n\nAntecentrix positions itself as the shield of the beastfolk, the military power that keeps human expansion in check. They demand recognition and resources from other beastfolk nations, arguing that someone must bear the cost of defense. Ysgolion feeds their armies; this is acknowledged less often than the Legions' martial glory.\n\nYsgolion supplies everyone and is thanked by no one. Their quiet resentment grows.\n\nThe Saltraeth remain apart from land-based politics, acknowledging no authority but their own clan-structures. They raid human shipping but also trade with Noctria and hire out to Antecentrix when sea-power is needed. Other beastfolk find them strange — too changed by the sea, too willing to deal with anyone.\n\nCeunant remains apart, neither acknowledging Hintida's spiritual authority nor joining Antecentrix's military confederation. They are called upon in times of crisis and otherwise left alone. Their Dream-Walkers hold memories that make other beastfolk uncomfortable — proof of what the Empire did, and what was done in return during the Beasttide.\n\nAmong the human powers, Antheion dominates through age and agricultural wealth. Lucia dominates through naval supremacy and financial networks. Skaros commands respect through military reputation. Kartheia expands aggressively. The Syndikaia tries to remain neutral. Archepyros mediates and consecrates. They cooperate against beastfolk threats but compete fiercely otherwise.\n\nThe Marchlands suffer whoever wins.",

      "description": "**General Practices**\n\n**Dawn Observances**\n\nThe sun's return is never taken for granted. Common people face east as the sun rises—not formal prayer, just a pause in whatever they're doing. A farmer stops walking to the field. A mother holds her child toward the light for a moment. The gesture is a small, open-palmed lift toward the sun, fingers spread, as if catching warmth. This is called *tonalmaca* (\"giving tonal\") though it's receiving as much as giving—an acknowledgment of the exchange.\n\nThe phrase spoken at dawn varies by region:\n- Yolitzac: *\"Tonatiuh tlachiya\"* — \"The sun sees.\" (Affirmation that dawn happened, that belief held)\n- Yolica: *\"Tlaneci\"* — Simply \"It dawns.\" (Less anxious, more cyclical acceptance)\n- Yullqa: *\"Inti hamun\"* — \"The sun comes.\" (Warmer, more personal—the sun as relative returning)\n\n**Mealtime**\n\nBefore eating, the first bite or first sip is set aside—placed on a small dish, poured on the ground, or simply held up briefly. This \"feeds the age\" in miniature. In wealthy households, this portion goes to a household shrine. In poor households, it goes to the floor or outside the door. The gesture matters more than the destination.\n\nThe phrase is usually just *\"Tonal\"* spoken quietly—acknowledging that what you're about to consume is borrowed heat that will eventually return.\n\n**The Tonal-Touch**\n\nWhen speaking of the dead, when making a serious promise, or when feeling grateful for survival, people touch their chest over the heart with an open palm—where the tonal resides. This is so reflexive that people do it unconsciously while speaking. *\"My mother, tonal rest her\"* [touch]. *\"I swear by my tonal\"* [touch].\n\nA variation: touching the chest and then gesturing upward, palm open, when speaking of someone who died well. This indicates their tonal \"rose\" rather than merely dissipating.\n\n**Common Oaths and Exclamations**\n\n*Frustration/anger:*\n- *\"Yohualli!\"* — \"Darkness!\" (Invoking the enemy—like saying \"damn\")\n- *\"Mictlan take it\"* — Mictlan being the underworld/death realm\n- *\"Moon-cursed\"* — Adjective for something that keeps going wrong\n\n*Surprise:*\n- *\"Tonal!\"* — Like \"God!\" or \"Christ!\"—the sacred word as exclamation\n- *\"Tonatiuh's eye!\"* — \"Sun's eye!\" (Stronger, used for genuine shock)\n\n*Emphasis/swearing truth:*\n- *\"By my tonal\"* — Swearing on your life-heat; serious oath\n- *\"The sun sees\"* — Equivalent to \"God as my witness\"\n- *\"May my tonal rise\"* — \"May I die well if I'm lying\"\n\n*Relief:*\n- *\"The sun holds\"* — Everything's okay; the crisis passed\n- *\"Still warm\"* — More casual version; \"we're still alive\"",

      "description": "**Yolitzac (Imperial Core)**\n\nYolitzac is where the dualist theology is strongest—the eternal struggle between sun and moon, the belief that collective faith literally sustains the dawn. This creates a culture with an undercurrent of anxiety that other Yolcentla regions find exhausting.\n\n**Dawn Anxiety**\n\nIn Yolitzac, dawn isn't just acknowledged—it's *watched for*. The final hours of night carry genuine tension, especially in devout households.\n\nThe tradition of keeping someone awake through the pre-dawn hours is taken seriously here. In common households, family members rotate this duty. In wealthy households, servants handle it. The watcher keeps a small fire burning and faces east, alert for the first light. When the sun appears, they call out—*\"Tlanextia!\"* (\"It brightens!\")—and the household stirs.\n\nThe phrase that follows sunrise is *\"Tonatiuh tlachiya\"*—\"The sun sees.\" This is said with genuine relief. The night is over. Belief held. The enemy moon has retreated again.\n\nPeople who sleep through dawn without anyone watching are considered careless at best, faithless at worst. Visitors from other regions find this bewildering—surely the sun will rise whether you watch or not? Yolitzac natives find *that* attitude bewildering. *Of course* the sun rises because people believe it will. That's how it works.\n\n**Lunar Vigilance**\n\nThe moon is the defeated enemy who keeps returning. Full moons are nights of mild unease; lunar eclipses are spiritual crises.\n\nDuring a lunar eclipse, Yolitzac essentially shuts down. People gather in temples and public squares, drums beat continuously, and priests lead chanting designed to \"strengthen\" the sun. The fear is real: what if this time the moon wins? What if the sun doesn't come back?\n\nEven in daily life, references to the moon are mildly taboo. Calling something \"moon-touched\" or \"lunar\" implies it's cursed, unstable, or treasonous. The moon appears on no decorations, no art, no clothing. To paint the moon is to honor the enemy.\n\nPeople avoid looking directly at the moon when it's visible. Glancing is fine; staring is uncomfortable. Doing anything *by moonlight* that could be done by firelight or waited for dawn is vaguely improper.\n\n**Confession of Doubts**\n\nYolitzac theology holds that doubt weakens the collective faith that sustains the sun. This creates a practice somewhere between religious confession and mental hygiene: regular unburdening of doubts to priests.\n\nCommon people visit temple for this monthly or when troubled. The priest listens, offers reassurance, and performs a small ritual to \"release\" the doubt—often involving breathing over a flame, letting the fire consume the weakness. The goal isn't punishment but *relief*. You've had dark thoughts; that's human. Now let them go so they don't fester and spread.\n\nThis makes Yolitzac culture uncomfortable with unexpressed negativity. Doubts, fears, despair—these should be spoken and released, not harbored. Someone who seems troubled but won't talk about it is spiritually dangerous. They're hoarding darkness.\n\n**Yolitzac Oaths and Exclamations**\n\n*Frustration/anger:*\n- *\"Yohualli!\"* — \"Darkness!\" The basic curse\n- *\"Moon take it\"* — Stronger; consigning something to the enemy\n- *\"Eclipse-cursed\"* — Something that keeps failing; the worst luck\n- *\"Mictlan's teeth\"* — Invoking the death realm; crude but common\n\n*Surprise:*\n- *\"Tonatiuh!\"* — \"Sun!\" The basic exclamation\n- *\"Light of heaven!\"* — Stronger surprise\n- *\"The sun sees!\"* — Can be surprise or emphasis\n\n*Fear/unease:*\n- *\"The moon watches\"* — Something feels wrong; bad omen\n- *\"Dark hours\"* — A dangerous or uncertain time\n- *\"Fading light\"* — Things are getting worse\n\n*Emphasis/swearing truth:*\n- *\"By the sun's eye\"* — Standard oath\n- *\"May I face the dark\"* — Serious oath; if I lie, let me face the moon's victory\n- *\"The Tonalpouhqui hears\"* — Invoking the religious authority; very formal\n- *\"On my tonal, before the light\"* — Strongest oath; combining personal and cosmic stakes\n\n*Relief:*\n- *\"The sun holds\"* — Crisis passed; the light endures\n- *\"Dawn comes\"* — Reassurance; this darkness is temporary\n- *\"Still bright\"* — We're okay; the faith holds\n\n*Contempt:*\n- *\"Moon-gazer\"* — Someone suspected of disloyalty or heresy\n- *\"Night-lover\"* — Stronger insult; someone who embraces darkness\n- *\"Doubter\"* — Serious accusation; someone whose weakness endangers everyone\n\n**Yolitzac Gestures**\n\nThe *tonal-touch* (palm to chest) is universal across Yolcentla, but Yolitzac adds a specific gesture for dawn: palm open, fingers spread, lifted toward the rising sun. This is done automatically upon seeing sunrise, often accompanied by *\"Tonatiuh tlachiya.\"*\n\nWhen speaking of the moon or darkness or anything ill-omened, a quick gesture of *aversion*—hand flicked outward, palm out, as if pushing something away. This is reflexive; people do it while speaking without noticing.\n\nWhen entering a temple or passing a significant shrine, Yolitzac people touch their eyes and then gesture toward the flame—*the fire that helps me see, that keeps the darkness back.*",

Battle-sacrifice feeds the age; military excellence is spiritual achievement.\n\n**Morning Practice**\n\nWarriors and aspiring warriors (which is most young men and many young women) begin each day with martial exercises. This isn't optional self-improvement; it's religious obligation. A body trained for battle is an offering prepared. Even non-warriors do simplified versions—stretches, basic forms, something to show willing.\n\nThe sun is the Eagle here—*Cuauhtli*—and dawn is when the Eagle descends from the heavens to survey the earth. Morning prayers face east but also *upward*, acknowledging the predator-sun circling above.\n\n**Battle Theology**\n\nDeath in battle is the highest death. The tonal of a fallen warrior doesn't merely \"rise\"—it joins the Eagle's entourage, circling the sun itself. Warriors who die in bed are pitied; their tonal rises but never reaches the same heights.\n\nThis creates a culture that valorizes struggle, confrontation, proving oneself through combat. Cuauhtemoc people are direct, sometimes abrasively so. Avoiding conflict is avoiding contribution.\n\n**Cuauhtemoc Oaths and Exclamations**\n\n- *\"Eagle's shadow!\"* — Surprise or emphasis; the sun is watching\n- *\"Blood and sun\"* — Acknowledgment of sacrifice; used like \"amen\"\n- *\"May the Eagle take me\"* — Oath; let me die in battle if I lie\n- *\"Coward's death\"* — Curse; may you die in bed, achieving nothing\n- *\"Feed the age\"* — Encouragement before difficulty; this struggle matters\n- *\"The Eagle sees\"* — Emphasis; the sun-as-predator witnesses this\n\n**Cuauhtemoc Gestures**\n\nBefore battle or any serious confrontation, Cuauhtemoc warriors touch their chest (tonal) and then gesture upward with a claw-like hand—offering themselves to the Eagle.\n\nWhen speaking of honored dead who fell in battle, the gesture is both hands rising, fingers spread, like something ascending. When speaking of those who died ingloriously, the gesture is smaller, more contained—a polite acknowledgment that their tonal rose, but not *that* high.",

      "description": "**Xochimilca (Place of Flower Fields)**\n\nThe agricultural heartland—less glamorous than Cuauhtemoc, far more important. Xochimilca feeds the continent. Their theology emphasizes cycles, growth, patience.\n\n**Seasonal Religion**\n\nWhere Yolitzac watches daily for dawn, Xochimilca watches yearly for seasons. The turning of agricultural cycles—planting, growing, harvest, fallow—mirrors the turning of cosmic ages. Farmers participate in sustaining the world through their work itself.\n\nThe key observances happen at seasonal transitions. Planting season begins with community rituals where seeds are blessed and the first furrows are cut by priests. Harvest ends with festivals of gratitude and controlled excess—eating, drinking, celebrating before the lean times.\n\nDaily observances are gentler than elsewhere. Morning acknowledgment of the sun, yes, but without Yolitzac's anxiety. A farmer might simply pause at the field's edge, face the sun, and say *\"Tlaneci, tlalli\"*—\"It dawns, earth.\" Then get to work.\n\n**Flower Symbolism**\n\nFlowers represent the beauty that emerges from earth and sun together—the visible proof that the cycle works. Xochimilca homes always have flowers when available. Offerings at household shrines include flowers before almost anything else.\n\nThe phrase *\"in xochitl\"*—\"the flower\"—can mean beauty, truth, worthiness, or rightness. Something done well is \"flowering.\" A good person has \"flower-heart.\" The poetry tradition for which Xochimilca is famous is called \"flower-song.\"\n\n**Xochimilca Oaths and Exclamations**\n\n- *\"Flower and root!\"* — Basic exclamation; surprise or emphasis\n- *\"Good soil\"* — Approval; something is well-founded\n- *\"Barren ground\"* — Disapproval; something fruitless or cursed\n- *\"The cycle turns\"* — Acceptance of change, good or bad\n- *\"In xochitl, in cuicatl\"* — \"The flower, the song\"—formula for truth and beauty; used to seal agreements\n- *\"By the turning\"* — Oath invoking the cosmic cycle\n- *\"May my fields salt\"* — Serious curse or oath; agricultural devastation\n\n**Xochimilca Gestures**\n\nWhen speaking of growth, hope, or good outcomes, Xochimilca people make a small opening gesture with their hands—like a flower blooming. This is often unconscious.\n\nBefore eating, the gesture involves touching the food and then touching the earth (or floor, symbolically)—acknowledging the cycle that produced this meal.\n\nAt funerals, flowers are everywhere, and mourners wear flower crowns. The dead become part of the earth that grows new flowers; grief and hope are intertwined.",

      "description": "**Micteca (Place of the Dead)**\n\nBuilt around a massive Primordial access point—likely a vast cave system—Micteca specializes in death. Other kingdoms find them unsettling; everyone needs them.\n\n**Death as Profession**\n\nMicteca priests are specialists in dying well. Important people from across Yolcentla send their dying to Micteca, or summon Micteca priests to attend final moments. The work involves preparing the dying person's tonal for its journey, negotiating with ancestors who will receive them, and ensuring the death \"takes\" properly so the soul doesn't linger or wander.\n\nThis makes Micteca culture unusually comfortable with mortality. Where others avoid death-talk, Micteca people discuss it plainly. This isn't morbidity—it's professional competence. A Micteca native might calmly assess how someone will probably die and what preparations would be advisable, then be baffled when others find this conversation uncomfortable.\n\n**The Living and the Dead**\n\nThe caves beneath Micteca are where the Primordial runs close enough to touch. Priests descend to commune with the accumulated dead, carry messages, seek advice. Coming back up is not guaranteed—some priests stay too long and return strange, or don't return at all.\n\nCommon people don't enter the deep caves, but they live in proximity to the dead in ways others don't. Ancestor consultation is casual and frequent. Before major decisions, a Micteca native might visit a cave-mouth shrine to \"ask the family\"—not a formal séance, just a quiet conversation with those below.\n\n**Micteca Oaths and Exclamations**\n\n- *\"Mictlan's breath\"* — Basic exclamation (the underworld breathes out from the caves)\n- *\"Bones and shadow\"* — Stronger emphasis\n- *\"The dead know\"* — Affirmation of truth; you can't lie to those below\n- *\"By those who wait\"* — Oath invoking ancestors\n- *\"May I wander\"* — Serious oath; the worst fate is a soul that can't find rest\n- *\"Good journey\"* — Farewell, especially to the dying but also general use\n- *\"The caves remember\"* — Warning; secrets don't stay secret\n\n**Micteca Gestures**\n\nWhen speaking of the dead, Micteca people gesture *downward*—the opposite of most Yolcentla cultures. The dead are below, in the caves, in the earth. A downward palm-press acknowledges them.\n\nWhen passing cave-mouths or shrines to the dead, a pause and slight bow—not fearful, but respectful. You're at a threshold. Those on the other side are watching.\n\nMicteca greetings often include a phrase outsiders find morbid: *\"Still walking?\"* The answer is *\"Still walking.\"* It's not pessimism—it's acknowledgment of the obvious. Everyone dies. We're still here today. That's worth noting.",

      "description": "**Oliken (The City-States)**\n\nThe southern lowlands are fragmented into rival city-states sharing cultural roots but competing constantly. The Hero Twins prophecy is central: two figures who will descend to the Primordial and outwit death itself.\n\n**Prophetic Competition**\n\nEach major city claims the Hero Twins will emerge from *their* sacred sites. This isn't abstract theology—it's civic identity and political legitimacy. If your city produces the Twins, you rule Oliken. Maybe all of Yolcentla.\n\nThis creates cities obsessed with signs, omens, exceptional children, and prophetic interpretation. Any unusual birth (twins especially, but also strange circumstances, exceptional beauty, or unusual markings) gets examined by priests. Most are dismissed. Some are watched. Very rarely, someone is declared a candidate.\n\nThe pressure on these candidates is immense. Most fail to demonstrate the necessary qualities and are quietly retired from consideration. A few go mad. The very rare success—a candidate who demonstrates genuine supernatural ability—becomes a political earthquake.\n\n**Cenote Veneration**\n\nThe cenotes (natural sinkholes filled with water) are sacred access points to the Primordial. The cities are built around them. Pilgrims come to make offerings, seek visions, and sometimes to sacrifice.\n\nWater from cenotes is holy. Wealthy households import it for important rituals. Bathing in cenote water is purifying. Drowning in a cenote—accidental or sacrificial—is a particularly powerful death, the tonal going directly into the Primordial rather than rising to the sun.\n\n**Oliken Oaths and Exclamations**\n\n- *\"Twins witness!\"* — Basic oath; invoking the awaited heroes\n- *\"Cenote-deep\"* — Something profound, serious, or hidden\n- *\"By the water below\"* — Stronger oath; the sacred pools\n- *\"Death-outwitters\"* — Praise for someone clever; invoking the Twins' legendary cunning\n- *\"May the Twins pass me by\"* — Oath with a twist; if I lie, let me not be chosen (being a Twin candidate is an honor but also a burden)\n- *\"Which city?\"* — Challenge; \"who do you think you are?\" (everyone's civic pride is tender)\n- *\"Ball-court rules\"* — A situation where the stakes are absolute; in the mythic ball game, losers die\n\n**Oliken Gestures**\n\nWhen making serious oaths, Oliken people often cup their hands as if holding water—the cenote, the sacred pool, the access to the Primordial.\n\nWhen speaking of the Twins (the prophecy, not actual twins), a gesture of two fingers raised—index and middle finger together. This is also a sign of hope, used when encouraging someone facing long odds.\n\nCivic pride is touchy. When an Oliken native names their home city, there's often a small unconscious gesture of emphasis—a hand to heart, a slight lift of the chin. Insulting someone's city is fighting words.",

Religious practice is more transactional than elsewhere—offerings made for specific purposes, results expected. The gods (or the sun, or the sea, or the ancestors) are trading partners, not masters.\n\n**Maritime Religion**\n\nThe sea is the second power here—not opposed to the sun but parallel to it. Fishers and sailors make offerings to both: to the sun for light and warmth, to the sea for fish and safe passage. Neither is neglected; both can kill you.\n\nSea-offerings happen at the water's edge. Before launching, sailors pour a small amount of alcohol into the waves. Returning safely, they pour more. The sea is thanked but not trusted—\"the sea is hungry\" is a common saying, acknowledging that the water takes as much as it gives.\n\n**Syncretic Tolerance**\n\nChalatica ports host beastfolk traders, and their religious practices have leaked in around the edges. Some Chalatica families have adopted ancestor practices that look suspiciously like beastfolk gwraidd-veneration. Orthodox priests disapprove. Merchants shrug. Whatever works.\n\nThis makes Chalatica people religiously flexible in ways that shock inland visitors. A Chalatica merchant might participate in a beastfolk offering ritual for business reasons and see nothing wrong with it. \"All roads reach the same harbor,\" they say—a phrase that would be heresy in Yolitzac.\n\n**Chalatica Oaths and Exclamations**\n\n- *\"Sun and sea!\"* — Basic exclamation; covering both powers\n- *\"Salt take it\"* — Frustration; the sea as devourer\n- *\"Good wind\"* — Approval; favorable conditions\n- *\"By the harbor\"* — Oath invoking home port; for Chalatica, where you dock matters more than which god you invoke\n- *\"All roads reach\"* — Acceptance; there's more than one way\n- *\"The tide knows\"* — The sea reveals truth; secrets wash up eventually\n- *\"Dryfoot\"* — Mild insult; someone who doesn't understand the sea (and therefore the world)\n\n**Chalatica Gestures**\n\nWhen speaking of luck, fortune, or hope, Chalatica people make a small wave-motion with one hand—the unpredictable sea that might favor you.\n\nWhen entering into agreements, the merchant gesture is an open hand extended, then turned palm-up—*showing you have nothing hidden, inviting inspection.* This has become a general Chalatica greeting among social equals.\n\nWhen speaking of the dead, the gesture depends on how they died. Died at sea: wave-motion, looking toward the water. Died on land: the standard tonal-touch and upward gesture. The sea keeps its dead differently than the sun does.",

      "description": "**The Raft-Cities**\n\nFloating communities that follow fishing and trade routes rather than claiming land. The most heterodox population in Yolcentla—their religion has drifted so far from orthodoxy that other humans barely recognize it.\n\n**No Fixed Shrines**\n\nRaft-City religion is entirely portable. No temples, no sacred sites tied to land. The sun is still acknowledged, but the sea has become nearly equal—and the Raft-Cities have developed practices around the *deep*, the dark waters below, that other humans find disturbing.\n\nThey believe the Primordial isn't just below the earth—it's below the water. The deep ocean *is* the accumulated dead, vast and patient. When a Raft-City native dies, they're given to the sea—a burial that other Yolcentla cultures consider horrifying. *How will their tonal rise if they're dragged down?*\n\nThe Raft-Cities answer: maybe tonal doesn't need to rise. Maybe the deep is another kind of destination. They're vague about details, which only makes other humans more suspicious.\n\n**Community as Shrine**\n\nWhat the Raft-Cities do venerate intensely is *each other*. A raft-community is family, crew, congregation, and nation all in one. The bonds between raft-mates are the closest thing they have to sacred architecture.\n\nNew members are adopted through serious ritual. Leaving is possible but painful—a kind of exile. Betraying raft-mates is the worst crime: not just social rupture but spiritual catastrophe.\n\n**Raft-City Oaths and Exclamations**\n\n- *\"Deep and sun!\"* — Basic exclamation; both cosmic powers\n- *\"By my raft\"* — Oath invoking community; the most serious Raft-City promise\n- *\"Sinking\"* — Curse; something failing badly\n- *\"Float on\"* — Encouragement; keep going, stay above water\n- *\"The deep waits\"* — Acknowledgment of mortality; not fearful, just factual\n- *\"Land-bound\"* — Insult; someone stuck, limited, unable to move with the world\n- *\"What raft?\"* — Challenge; \"who are your people?\" (a stranger with no community is suspect)\n\n**Raft-City Gestures**\n\nWhen making oaths, Raft-City people place both hands flat on the deck (or whatever surface is available)—connecting to the raft, to the community, to what's real.\n\nWhen greeting raft-mates after separation, the embrace is full—arms around each other, heads together. These people are everything to each other.\n\nWhen speaking of the dead given to the sea, the gesture is palms down, pressing toward the water (or floor). Not the upward gesture for rising tonal—a downward acknowledgment that the dead went *below*, and that's okay.",

      "description": "**Yullqa (The Highlands — Ayni)**\n\nIn the Yullqa highlands, every interaction is part of the web of ayni—balanced exchange. This shapes even tiny daily moments.\n\n**Exchange as Existence**\n\nMorning begins with offerings—not to deities in an abstract sense, but to *specific entities you owe*. Ancestors get coca leaves or food. The house gets thanks for shelter. The mountain gets acknowledgment for existing. The phrases are personal: *\"For grandmother, who taught me.\"* *\"For the stones that hold this house.\"* *\"Ayni to the water.\"*\n\nThis sounds elaborate, but in practice it's quick—a few muttered acknowledgments while leaving small offerings in established spots. What matters is the *regularity*, the maintenance of relationships.\n\n**Everything is Exchange**\n\nBefore drinking water: *\"Ayni.\"* Before eating: *\"Ayni.\"* The word serves as grace, acknowledgment, reminder.\n\nWhen receiving anything—a gift, help, even information—the response is *\"Ayni\"* rather than \"thank you.\" \"Thank you\" implies the exchange is complete, the debt settled. *\"Ayni\"* acknowledges that the exchange is never complete—you now owe something, and that's how it should be.\n\nWhen giving anything, you say *\"Ayni\"* too. *You're taking on an obligation to receive later; this is also part of the balance.*\n\nYullqa people are uncomfortable with gifts that can't be reciprocated. Receiving something from someone you can never repay (a king, a stranger you'll never see again) creates spiritual debt that can't be balanced. Some Yullqa people will refuse gifts for this reason, or insist on giving something—anything—in return.\n\n**Yullqa Oaths and Exclamations**\n\n*Frustration/anger:*\n- *\"Broken ayni!\"* — Something's out of balance; someone violated the exchange\n- *\"Taker!\"* — Insult; someone who takes without giving\n- *\"Owed too much\"* — A situation that's gotten out of hand\n- *\"No return\"* — Something's been lost beyond recovery\n\n*Surprise:*\n- *\"Ayni!\"* — Basic exclamation (yes, the same word used for everything)\n- *\"What balances?\"* — \"What's happening?\" (What exchange is occurring?)\n- *\"Mountain's breath!\"* — Stronger surprise\n\n*Emphasis/swearing truth:*\n- *\"By the balance\"* — Standard oath\n- *\"May my ayni break\"* — Serious oath; let my exchanges fail if I lie\n- *\"The ancestors weigh\"* — They're tracking the balance; formal invocation\n- *\"On the road\"* — Swearing on the Qhapaq Ñan, the sacred road network; very serious\n\n*Acceptance:*\n- *\"Ayni balances\"* — What goes around comes around; acceptance of fortune or misfortune\n- *\"What goes, returns\"* — Proverb; the web holds\n- *\"The debt is known\"* — Acknowledging an obligation\n\n*Gratitude/acknowledgment:*\n- *\"Ayni, friend\"* — Thank you, but also \"I owe you now, and that's good\"\n- *\"The return will come\"* — Promise to reciprocate\n- *\"We are bound\"* — Positive; we're in ayni together, we have mutual obligations\n\n**Yullqa Gestures**\n\nThe *double-handed exchange*—everything is given and received with both hands when possible. One hand implies casualness or disrespect; two hands shows the exchange matters.\n\nWhen speaking of obligations, Yullqa people often make a *weighing gesture*—hands moving up and down as if balancing scales. *Assessing the ayni.*\n\nWhen making promises, a hand on the chest, then extended toward the other person—*from my balance to yours.*",

Incense optional, more common in southern regions.\n\nEvening *jìngzuò* is about releasing the day—letting go of frustrations, disappointments, struggles. *Don't carry nì (resistance) into sleep.*\n\nCommon people often skip formal sitting but still have a moment of quiet before starting work.

Citizens interact with it directly and indirectly throughout daily life.\n\nEvery citizen household maintains a *small flame*—an oil lamp or candle that is theoretically lit from the central Flame and never allowed to die. In practice, flames do go out and are quietly relit, but households are embarrassed about it. The home flame is kept in a prominent place, often by the entrance.\n\nWhen leaving the house, many citizens pause briefly at their home flame, touching the lamp or holder. *Carrying the koinon with you.* When returning, the same gesture—*bringing yourself back to the collective.*\n\nStreet shrines and small public flames dot the city at intersections, market squares, and gates. Passing citizens make a small gesture—touching fingers to lips then extending toward the flame, or a brief palm-out acknowledgment. Not every time, but regularly. Rushing past without acknowledgment, especially at major shrines, is noticed.",

The Hwarang formalized this into elaborate dawn training, but common people just... move first.\n\nTea follows morning movement.

      "description": "**Aohane Humans**\n\nA small human population exists in Aohane's port towns—traders, diplomatic staff, and families who have lived there for generations. They occupy an odd position: tolerated, sometimes valued, but never fully part of Pavonine society. They cannot display. They have no plumage. Their kagami, if they have one, is invisible.\n\n**Adapted Practices**\n\nAohane humans have developed their own version of kagami-practice, focused on what they *can* show: clothing, bearing, expression, voice.\n\nMorning grooming matters here more than anywhere else humans live. An Aohane human takes care with their appearance—not Pavonine-style feather-arrangement, but careful attention to clothing, hair, cleanliness. To appear disheveled is to show disrespect for the principle of display, even if you can't display like a Pavonine.\n\nColor in clothing carries weight. Aohane humans wear brighter colors than humans elsewhere typically would—not garish, but *visible*. Dressing in dull browns and grays reads as hiding yourself, as failed kagami. The wealthy compete in fabric quality and dye richness; the poor at least keep their clothes clean and mended.\n\n**The Voice as Display**\n\nSince humans can't communicate through feather-position, Aohane humans have developed unusual attention to vocal expression. Tone, clarity, musicality—these become the human equivalent of plumage.\n\nSpeaking in a flat monotone is considered as rude as a Pavonine hiding their crest. Aohane humans learn to *perform* their speech: clear articulation, expressive tone, appropriate volume. Mumbling is shameful. Children are trained in vocal exercises the way Pavonine children are trained in display-postures.\n\nThis makes Aohane humans distinctive when they travel. Other humans find them theatrical, overly expressive, \"always performing.\" They find other humans muffled, hidden, spiritually closed.\n\n**Religious Syncretism**\n\nMost Aohane humans have adopted kagami-theology at least partially. They speak of \"showing truly\" and \"false colors\" and accept the basic premise that authenticity is virtue. But they've adapted it to human limitations.\n\nSome have developed a theology of *inner kagami*—the idea that humans display through actions and words rather than plumage, that their soul shines through behavior rather than feathers. This is heterodox from a Pavonine perspective (kagami should be *visible*), but it's tolerated as a reasonable human adaptation.\n\nOthers maintain their ancestral faiths privately while performing kagami-observance publicly. A human family might keep a small shrine to Zhiran-style ancestors or Yolcentla-style sun-worship in their home, then step outside and greet neighbors with \"Bright kagami!\" This dual practice is common and unremarked.\n\n**Aohane Human Oaths and Exclamations**\n\nAohane humans use many Pavonine expressions but have developed their own variants:\n\n- *\"Bright kagami!\"* — Adopted directly; standard greeting\n- *\"By my voice\"* — Human adaptation; swearing on their form of display\n- *\"True-spoken\"* — Equivalent to \"true colors\" but for verbal honesty\n- *\"May my words dull\"* — Oath; let my voice lose its clarity if I lie\n- *\"Cloth and color!\"* — Surprise; invoking their form of display\n- *\"Dressed dark\"* — Criticism; someone hiding, not showing themselves\n- *\"Good showing\"* — Praise; someone presenting themselves well\n\n**Aohane Human Gestures**\n\nWithout feathers to manipulate, Aohane humans have developed substitute gestures:\n\nThe *color-touch*—briefly touching your own clothing when speaking of honesty or identity. Where a Pavonine might fan their tail, a human touches their bright sleeve. *This is what I show. This is my kagami.*\n\nThe *open-hand greeting*—palms up, arms slightly spread, showing you have nothing hidden. This has become the standard human greeting in Aohane, replacing bows or handshakes.\n\nWhen speaking of the dead, Aohane humans look up like Pavonines do, but instead of a wing-flutter, they make a small gesture with both hands—fingers spreading upward like something rising and dispersing. *The display complete. The kagami returning.*\n\n**Tensions**\n\nAohane humans live with a quiet awareness that they can never fully belong. No matter how bright their clothes, how musical their voice, how sincere their kagami-practice—they cannot *display*. They are spiritually limited in Pavonine eyes, doing their best with what they have.\n\nSome Aohane humans resent this. A few have left for places where their humanity isn't a spiritual handicap. But many have made peace with it, finding dignity in their adapted practices, taking pride in being the best-dressed, clearest-voiced humans in the world.\n\nPavonines generally view Aohane humans with something between condescension and genuine respect. *They try. They cannot help what they are. And their voice-displays are genuinely impressive, for mammals.*",

The truth is more complicated. Humans invented the Aegis. Human scientists created PRIMA. The technology the Aegis now use descends from human innovation.

Most Aegis have never actually observed beastfolk society—they watch Terra from orbit, seeing cities and armies, but the nuance is lost. They do not understand that beastfolk created magic, that Satyr mages rival anything the old Empire produced, that the \"animals\" built civilizations while the Aegis argued about court politics.\n\n**\"Terran magic is crude instinct.\"** Aegis who study Terran magic are rare and often dismissed. The official position is that SOUL-channeling is a desperate adaptation, inferior to proper technology. In truth, Terran magic has developed sophisticated theory and practice over a millennium—the Aegis simply haven't bothered to learn it.",

The internal divisions—Yolitzac versus Yolica, Oliken city-state rivalries, Yullqa's independence—are unknown. The continent is imagined as one Empire.\n\n**\"Their magic is sacrificial blood-cult.\"** The stories that reach Tieravel emphasize the most dramatic elements of Solar Faith practice. The subtle theology, the regional variations, the sophisticated philosophy—none of this penetrates. Yolcentla is imagined as priests cutting out hearts over pyramids.",
